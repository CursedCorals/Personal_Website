<h1>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Lebron </h1>



<p>Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> , How I wonder what you are! 
    Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, 
    twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> , How I wonder what you are!. When the blazing sun  is gone, 
    When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. 
    Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> , How I wonder what you are!
</p>
<p> Then the traveller in the dark, Thanks you for your tiny spark, 
    He could not see which way to go, If you did not twinkle so. Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong>, 
    How I wonder what you are! In the dark blue sky you keep, And often through my curtains peep, 
    For you never shut your eye, Till the sun is in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong>, How I wonder what you are!    
</p>
<p>
As your bright and tiny spark, Lights the traveller in the dark,— Though I know not what you are, 
Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> . Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> , How I wonder what you are!
Twinkle, twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> , How I wonder what you are! 
Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, 
twinkle, little <strong><em>Lebron</em></strong> , How I wonder what you are!. When the blazing sun is gone, 
When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
